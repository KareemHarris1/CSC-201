## Intro
![](compare.jpg){width=100%}


* Model Notes:
  + random forest is a aggregation of multiple decision tree models
  + decision boundary is in the form of several rectandular sections
  + robust to different types of analysis, but prone to overfitting - must be "pruned"

* Model Uses
  + Classification, some regression
  + supervised machine learning

* Model Input
  + Countinuous and discrete
  
* Model Output
  + Discrete, but can also perform regression
  
* Model Fitting Algorithm
  + Decision tree
    + separate on variables that provide the most distinction between classes
    + continue separating until max depth has been reached 
  + Random Forest
    + run several decision trees at set depth, selecting variables to split on by choosing the best one among a preset number of randomly chosen variables from the test set. 
    + aggregate the models into one tree

### Example

* age: age in years
* sex: sex (1 = male; 0 =female)
* cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
* trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hopsital)
* choi: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; = 0 false)
* restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular * hypertrophy)
* thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
* exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)
* ca: number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by flourosopy
* thai: (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
* num: diagnosis of heart disease. It is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
