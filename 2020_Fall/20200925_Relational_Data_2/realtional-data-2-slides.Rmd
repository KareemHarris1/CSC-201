## Recap

* Relational data can be linked together with the use of keys: columns that are shared between the two data sets.

## Importing data
```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# setting the working directory so that I don't have to keep typing the same file path for every table. 
setwd('C:\\Users\\drew.howell\\Desktop\\CSC-201\\2020_Fall\\20200925_Relational_Data_2')

balance_type <- read_xlsx('mortgages.xlsx', sheet = 'Main')
rates <- read_xlsx('mortgages.xlsx', sheet = 'Rates')
location <- read_xlsx('mortgages.xlsx', sheet = 'Location')
start_date <- read_xlsx('mortgages.xlsx', sheet = 'Start Date')
status <- read_xlsx('mortgages.xlsx', sheet = 'Status')
cost <- read_xlsx('mortgages.xlsx', sheet = 'Cost')
```

## Joining location

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
#get column names
names(balance_type)
names(location)

working_main_1 <- full_join(balance_type, location)

# compare the row numbers
nrow(balance_type)
nrow(location)
nrow(working_main_1)

# compare the column nams
names(working_main_1)
```

## Start date

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
names(working_main_1)
names(start_date)

working_main_2 <- full_join(working_main_1, start_date, by = c('Account' = 'Loan_Number'))

# compare the row numbers
nrow(working_main_1)
nrow(start_date)
nrow(working_main_2)

# compare the column nams
names(working_main_2)
```

## Status 

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
names(working_main_2)
names(status)

working_main_3 <- full_join(working_main_2, status, by = c('Account' = 'Acct'))

# compare the row numbers
nrow(working_main_2)
nrow(status)
nrow(working_main_3)

# compare the column nams
names(working_main_3)
```

## Cost 

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
names(working_main_3)
names(cost)

# looks like they both have a type column, although it's named differently. 

working_main_4 <- full_join(working_main_3, cost, by = c('Type' = 'Loan_Type'))

# compare the row numbers
nrow(working_main_3)
nrow(cost)
nrow(working_main_4)

# compare the column nams
names(working_main_4)
```

## Rates

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
head(rates$year)
head(working_main_4$Start_Date)
class(working_main_4$Start_Date)
working_main_4$Start_Date <- as.Date(working_main_4$Start_Date)

library(lubridate)

working_main_4 <- working_main_4 %>%
  mutate(start_year = year(Start_Date))

names(working_main_4)
names(rates)

# looks like they both have a type column, although it's named differently. 

working_main_5 <- full_join(working_main_4, rates, by = c('start_year' = 'year'))

# compare the row numbers
nrow(working_main_4)
nrow(status)
nrow(working_main_5)

# compare the column nams
names(working_main_5)

# all of the tables have been joined together, so I'm going to make a new data set named "main"
main <- working_main_5
```

## Checking for duplicates

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
# first we want to check if there are duplicates in the Account column, because we don't want to be counting loans twice in our analysis. 
TRUE %in% duplicated(main$Account)

# since that yields TRUE, we know that there are duplicates. So let's try to filter down to the rows that are marked duplicated.
dupes <- main %>%
  filter(duplicated(Account))
```


```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
duplicated(c(NA, NA))
```

### Rates duplicates

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
min(main$Start_Date)

#got an NA, so I need to add the na.rm = T argument
min(main$Start_Date, na.rm = T)
```

### Type duplicates

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
main_no_na <- main[!is.na(main$Account),]

main_no_na %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
```

```{r, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
unique(main_no_na$Type) %in% cost$Loan_Type

#put this in a dataframe so we can tell which ones. 
check <- data.frame(
  Type = unique(main_no_na$Type),
  InCost = unique(main_no_na$Type) %in% cost$Loan_Type
)

unique(cost$Loan_Type)
```
